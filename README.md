### Introduction

In this example, we're going to build a small online order fulfillment system. It will join two events within a stream: one event type containing customer orders and another containing successful payments. The dataflow will emit completed orders for each customer that have been paid.

## ****Prerequisites****

**Sample Data**

Make a file named `data/cart-join.json` with the following data:

```json
{"user_id": "a", "type": "order", "order_id": 1}
{"user_id": "a", "type": "order", "order_id": 2}
{"user_id": "b", "type": "order", "order_id": 3}
{"user_id": "a", "type": "payment", "order_id": 2}
{"user_id": "b", "type": "order", "order_id": 4}
FAIL HERE
{"user_id": "a", "type": "payment", "order_id": 1}
{"user_id": "b", "type": "payment", "order_id": 4}
```

## Step 1. Dataflow

A dataflow is the unit of work in Bytewax. Dataflows are data-parallel directed acyclic graphs that are made up of processing steps.

Let's start by creating an empty dataflow with no input or processing steps.

https://github.com/bytewax/recoverable-cart-join/blob/32ce594e8c3ce547c264ecbcbcbc48d6b38c37bb/dataflow.py#L1-L3

## Step 2. Input

In a production application you would most likely be using something like Kafka or Redpanda as the input source. In this example, we will use the `FileInput` source that reads from the file we created earlier and emits one line at a time into our dataflow. `FileInput` is a recoverable input source, which will come in handy later:

https://github.com/bytewax/recoverable-cart-join/blob/32ce594e8c3ce547c264ecbcbcbc48d6b38c37bb/dataflow.py#L5-L7

Each of the lines in the file is a JSON encoded string. Let's add a step to decode our input into a Python dictionary.

https://github.com/bytewax/recoverable-cart-join/blob/32ce594e8c3ce547c264ecbcbcbc48d6b38c37bb/dataflow.py#L9-L13

Our plan is to use the `stateful_map` operator to perform the join between customers and orders. All stateful operators require their input data to be in the form of a `(key, value)` tuple so that Bytewax can ensure that all tems for a given `key` end up on the same worker.

Let's add that key field using the `user_id` field present in every event.

https://github.com/bytewax/recoverable-cart-join/blob/32ce594e8c3ce547c264ecbcbcbc48d6b38c37bb/dataflow.py#L26-L30

Now onto the join itself. Stateful map needs two functions: a `builder` that creates the initial, empty state whenever a new key is encountered, and a `mapper` that combines new items into the existing state.

Our builder function will create the initial dictionary to hold the relevant data.

https://github.com/bytewax/recoverable-cart-join/blob/32ce594e8c3ce547c264ecbcbcbc48d6b38c37bb/dataflow.py#L33-L34

Now we need the join logic, which will return two values: the updated state and the item to emit downstream. Since we'd like to continuously be emitting the most updated join info, we'll return the updated state each time the joiner is called.

https://github.com/bytewax/recoverable-cart-join/blob/32ce594e8c3ce547c264ecbcbcbc48d6b38c37bb/dataflow.py#L37-L48

The items that stateful operators emit also have the relevant key still attached, so in this case we have `(user_id, joined_state)`. Let's format that into a dictionary for output.

https://github.com/bytewax/recoverable-cart-join/blob/32ce594e8c3ce547c264ecbcbcbc48d6b38c37bb/dataflow.py#L51-L57

Finally, capture this output and send it to STDOUT.

https://github.com/bytewax/recoverable-cart-join/blob/32ce594e8c3ce547c264ecbcbcbc48d6b38c37bb/dataflow.py#L62-L64

## Step 3. Execution

At this point our dataflow is constructed, and we can run it. Here we're setting our current directory as the path for our SQLite recovery store, and setting our epoch interval to 0, so that we can create a checkpoint of our state for every line in the file:

``` bash
> python -m bytewax.run dataflow --sqlite-directory . --epoch-interval 0

{'user_id': 'a', 'paid_order_ids': [], 'unpaid_order_ids': [1]}
{'user_id': 'a', 'paid_order_ids': [], 'unpaid_order_ids': [1, 2]}
{'user_id': 'b', 'paid_order_ids': [], 'unpaid_order_ids': [3]}
{'user_id': 'a', 'paid_order_ids': [2], 'unpaid_order_ids': [1]}
{'user_id': 'b', 'paid_order_ids': [], 'unpaid_order_ids': [3, 4]}

TypeError: JSONDecodeError.__init__() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'doc' and 'pos'
```

Something went wrong! In this case it was that we had a non-JSON line `FAIL HERE` in the input, but you could imagine that the VM is killed or something else bad happened!

We've also built up very valuable state in our stateful map operator and we don't want to pay the penalty of having to re-read our input all the way from the beginning. Thankfully, we enabled recovery when running our Dataflow, and after we fix the bug, we can resume from where we left off.

https://github.com/bytewax/recoverable-cart-join/blob/32ce594e8c3ce547c264ecbcbcbc48d6b38c37bb/dataflow.py#L16-L20

If we change this line:

https://github.com/bytewax/recoverable-cart-join/blob/32ce594e8c3ce547c264ecbcbcbc48d6b38c37bb/dataflow.py#L23

To use our "bugfixed" function, we can re-run the dataflow and finish processing the items in the file:

``` bash
> python -m bytewax.run dataflow --sqlite-directory . --epoch-interval 0
{'user_id': 'a', 'paid_order_ids': [2, 1], 'unpaid_order_ids': []}
{'user_id': 'b', 'paid_order_ids': [4], 'unpaid_order_ids': [3]}
```

Notice how the system did not forget the information from the previous invocation; we still see that user `a` has paid order_ids `2` and `1`.

## Summary

Recoverable dataflows are key to any production system. This tutorial demonstrated how you can use `stateful_map` to join two event types together from a stream of incoming data.
